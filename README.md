# Primijenjena-Matematika-3F
A simple educational website for Applied Mathematics designed for 3rd grade high school students.

This project provides interactive tools to work with matrices directly in the browser, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Features
1. **Matrix Input Interface** -> Enter custom matrices through a dynamic input grid. The interface allows you to set the matrix dimensions and input values manually.

2. **Transpose Matrix** -> Generate the transpose of a matrix, flipping its rows and columns. This is helpful for understanding matrix properties and transformations.

3. **Symmetry Check** -> Determine whether a matrix is symmetric (equal to its transpose). This is a useful concept in linear algebra and helps in understanding matrix properties.

4. **Anti-Symmetry Check** -> Check if a matrix is anti-symmetric (equal to the negative of its transpose).

5. **Scalar Multiplication** -> Multiply any matrix by a scalar value. Each element of the matrix is scaled by the selected number.

6. **Matrix Addition and Subtraction** -> Add or subtract two matrices of the same dimensions. Useful for practicing and visualizing basic matrix operations.

7. **Matrix Multiplication** -> Multiply two compatible matrices using standard matrix multiplication rules. The result is automatically displayed with correct dimensions.
